Veteran Technologies consists of several sub-businesses that all have their own separate
projects/microservices most of which are relatively small and narrowly focused on one 
particular working unit of the overall application.
Try and pick the right place and project to contribute to so we can help you faster.

## Contributions

Thereâ€™s several ways to contribute, not just by writing code.

### Improve documentation

As a user of this project youâ€™re perfect for helping us improve our docs.
Typo corrections, error fixes, better explanations, new examples, etcetera.
Anything!

### Improve issues

Some issues lack information, arenâ€™t reproducible, or are just incorrect.
Help make them easier to resolve.

### Give feedback on issues

Weâ€™re always looking for more opinions on discussions in the issue tracker
as long as they are productive. 

### Write code

Code contributions are welcome.
Itâ€™s often good to first create an issue to report a bug or suggest a new
feature before creating a pull request to prevent you from doing unnecessary
work.

## Support

See [`SUPPORT.md`][support] on how to get help.

## Submitting an issue or bug

*   The [issue tracker](https://github.com/veterantechio/.github/issues) is for issues.
    See [`SUPPORT.md`][support] on how to get help.
*   Search the issue tracker (including closed issues) before opening a new
    issue
*   Use a clear and descriptive title
*   Include as much information as possible: steps to reproduce the issue,
    error message, operating system, etc. Anything that can help us track
    down the issue and resolve it ASAP. If you can find the commit where the bug was
    introduced, that would go a long ways to helping us resolve the issue ASAP!
*   The more time and effort you put into an issue, the more we will

## Submitting a pull request

*   Non-trivial changes are often best discussed in an issue first, to prevent
    you from doing unnecessary work
*   For ambitious tasks, you should try to get your work in front of the
    community for feedback as soon as possible
*   New features should be accompanied with tests and documentation
*   Updated features should also have updated documentation, unit tests, and E2E tests if needed
*   Run all available testing commands before submitting code by running (e.g. `npm test`, `npm e2e`, etc)
