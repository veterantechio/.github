# Security Policy

## Reporting a Security Vulnerability

If you find a security issue with any of our applications, do not open an issue 
on a public repository. This will reveal the security vulnerability to anyone who views 
the repository. You can submit a security vulnerability bug if the repo is private however.

If reporting a security vulnerability on a public repository, please email support@veterantech.io
with details of the security issue so that only company employees will see 
the details and be able to delegate the work to whomever can apply the needed fix(es).
